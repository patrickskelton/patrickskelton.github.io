        <h1><center>About Me</center></h1>
        <div id ="introduction"><center>
        <p>
            I graduated from Lancaster University in 2018 with a first-class degree in Theoretical Physics with Mathematics.
        </p><p> I am interested in a career in software because I have always had a passion
            and skill for solving problems and finding practical implementations for those solutions. This
            passion originally led me to studying Mathematics and Physics at university where I was
            introduced to coding and using coding to solve real-world problems.
        </p>
        <p>I realise the best way for me to improve my knowledge and understanding of
software coding and implementation is to gain personal experience in the sector and learn
from mentors and peers.
        </p>
        <p>I am technical minded and love learning
and challenges to develop my skills further.
        </p>
